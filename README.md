# automated-theorem-prover
Automated Theorem Prover for propositional logic implemented using Wang's algorithm, coded in Prolog

The whole code is in wangATP.pl file, output is the whole proof (formated in levels of proof like a tree), 
if the proof does not exist (if it is not a theorem, it shows the steps till the conslusion).
